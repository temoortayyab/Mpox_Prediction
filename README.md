# Background
The recent mpox outbreak, formerly known as Monkeypox, began gaining significant attention in May 2022. The outbreak was first reported in the United Kingdom and quickly spread to other countries. It was characterized by an unusual number of cases outside the regions where Mpox was typically endemic. In August 2024, the World Health Organization declared mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Creating a machine learning model to predict mpox based on signs and symptoms of suspected cases can significantly enhance early detection, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient management as well as an overall public health response. 

# Data Description and Project
This project develops and evaluates a predictive model for Mpox using a dataset that includes detailed information on patients' clinical features such as systemic illness, rectal pain, sore throat, and more, as well as data on sexually transmitted infections and HIV.  The dataset is not comprised of real-world data but is derived from a study that detailed the characteristics of mpox during the 2022 outbreak in London. More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammad4hmed/monkeypox-patients-dataset). 

The aim of this project is to assess how well these variables can predict the likelihood of Mpox infection and improve early detection and diagnostic accuracy. The notebook file describes the steps taken to develop the model, including information on data exploration and data cleaning, building and testing various machine learning algorithms, and conclusions.
